Generative Text Model
üéØ Project Objective
To build a text generation model capable of creating coherent and contextually relevant paragraphs based on user-provided prompts, using machine learning techniques like GPT or LSTM.

üîë Key Activities
Understand Generative Text Modeling
Study how models like GPT (transformers) or LSTM (RNNs) can be used for text generation.

Preprocess Dataset

Use a dataset (e.g., stories, news articles, poems)

Clean and tokenize the text

Model Building

Choose either:

GPT (via Hugging Face Transformers)

LSTM model (via TensorFlow/Keras)

Train the model or use pre-trained models

Text Generation

Accept a prompt from the user

Generate text based on that prompt

Notebook/Script Creation

Show code + generated text examples

Optionally add UI or CLI input prompt
