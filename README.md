Data Input

Accept or load long text (from file or user input).

Text Cleaning & Preprocessing

Remove stop words, punctuation, special characters, etc.

Summarization Process
You can use either:

Extractive summarization: Select key sentences using NLP/statistics (e.g., frequency, TF-IDF).

Abstractive summarization: Generate new sentences using deep learning (e.g., transformers).

Generate Output

Display or save the summary in text/image format.

(Optional): Build a simple GUI or CLI for easy user interaction.
